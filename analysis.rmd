#Analysis for Earth523

Today, I am learning how to write in **Rmarkdown**. So far, I have learned that I can:
- Write text describing my analysis
- Embed code with codue chunks
- Create HTMML, pdf or word output by specifying in the YAML header

[Here is my github page](https://github.com/zerualem/earth_523) for this analysis.

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(cars)
str(cars)
plot(cars)
max_speed <- max(cars$speed)

```

The average speed of the cars in the cars dataset is `r mean(cars$speed)`. The minimum spead is `r min(cars$speed)`. The max speed is `r max_speed`.
